# GesturalMixer

A DJ mixing application with hand gesture controls powered by machine learning. Control your music with intuitive hand movements captured through your webcam.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Controls**: Control various audio parameters using intuitive hand gestures
  - ü§ò Rock on/horns gesture (index + pinky): Volume control
  - ‚òùÔ∏è Index finger only: Low EQ control
  - ‚úåÔ∏è Peace sign: High EQ control
  - ‚úä Closed fist: Reverb control
  - üñêÔ∏è Open palm: All controls mode
  
- **Real-time Audio Visualization**: Beautiful 3D visualization that responds to your music
- **Multiple Audio Sources**: Load tracks from local files or Spotify (Premium account required)
- **Professional Audio Processing**: High-quality EQ and reverb effects

## Technologies Used

- React.js for the user interface
- TensorFlow.js and Handpose for hand gesture recognition
- Three.js for 3D audio visualization
- Tone.js for audio processing and effects
- WebGL shaders for advanced visual effects
